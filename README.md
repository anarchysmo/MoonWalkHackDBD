this thing allows you to moonwalk in dbd, it will not get detected by EasyAntiCheat because it is calling windows functions and have nothing to do with DBD process.
Activation: mouse4 (VK_XBUTTON1)
if you get turned becuse of ping you can increase/decrease keypress delay by doing END/INSERT buttons or you can set to default again (which is 130 btw) by pressing mouse 3 (VK_MBUTTON)
